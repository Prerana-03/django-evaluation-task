Problem Set 2 - A functioning web app with API
I. Please create a website - which should have two components:

Expose all the endpoints using Rest API, with proper permissions, authentication and documentation. Please refer to the image link - https://i.imgur.com/T0ZCO9A.png
Admin Facing - Where admin user can add an android app as well as the number of points - earned by user for downloading the app. (Please do not use the default Django Admin)
User Facing - where the user can see the apps added by the admin and the points. The user should be able to see the following fields. 
Signup and Login (Feel free to use any package for the same). 
Their Name and Profile
Points Earned.
Tasks completed. 
Option to upload a screenshot (which must include drag and drop) for that particular task. (Like if a user downloads a particular app), he can send a screenshot of the open app to confirm that he has indeed downloaded the app. 


Problem Set 3
Please answer the below questions:

A. Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?

B. In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa? 

Bonus points 
For good s/w eng practices: e.g. modularity, well documented (comments and README), Normalized db schema, requirements.txt etc. Blow my mind!

Please create a repository in GitLab(Not Github), and add @NLEvaluations for evaluation (Only maintainer’s access), and deploy it to any server and share the link. 
Please include a short video/screencast - running the evaluator through both the problem statement and your solution (While we will not assess the longer videos negatively, we’d prefer the videos to be under 5 minutes - and it should be very concise and to the point).
